# T - Shape Learning
- Deep Vertical -> Data Engineering (80%)
- Broad Exposure (20 %)

# Project First Learning
- Reading books is fine and necessary but not an end all be all. The focus should be on building first this grounds your understanding to something tangible and highlights gaps in knowledge. Additionally when reading books focus on thoroughly reading one book at a time instead of flipping between books.

# Daily Practice
- Consistent exposure over hero sessions has anecdotally produced better learnings for myself.
